Main Objective:
The main agenda of this project is:

Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset.
Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features.
DEPLOY the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurant ratings.
Directory Structure:
Files you will need:

• Model.py file

• .csv file

• template

• .html file

• .css file

• app.y file

Model.py: This file contains the code for building our model that is used in predicting the restaurant ratings
CSV file: This contains our data that we have already cleaned and saved
template file: The template file contains the HTML and CSS documents used in building our web app
App.py: This contains the Flask APIs that receive restaurant details via GUI/API calls, then make the prediction of restaurant ratings based on our model and return the rate.
